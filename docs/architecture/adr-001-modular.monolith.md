#### ADR-001: Use a Modular Monolith with a Three-Tier Client-Server Architecture

**Status:** Accepted

##### Context

*Inkwell* is a one-semester course project. A small team will build it step by step. The project already uses React, Express, PostgreSQL, and Prisma.

We need an architecture that is easy to build and maintain. It should support gradual development throughout the course. It should also avoid unnecessary complexity. At the same time, it should allow the system to grow in the future if needed.

##### Decision

*Inkwell* will use a **three-tier client-server architecture**.

- **Presentation tier:** A React single-page application.
- **Logic tier:** A single Express server organized as a **modular monolith** with three layers:
  - Routes
  - Services
  - Repositories
- **Data tier:** A PostgreSQL database accessed only through the Repository layer using Prisma.

The client and server can be deployed separately. However, the server remains a single application.

##### Alternatives Considered

**Microservices**

- Rejected because they add unnecessary complexity.
- They slow down development.
- Their scalability benefits are not needed for a project of this size.

**Server-rendered Monolith**

- Rejected because the server would generate the web pages.
- It does not follow the client-server architecture introduced earlier in the course.
- It also does not teach students how separate frontend and backend applications work together.

**Pipe-and-Filter or Event-Driven Architecture**

- Rejected as the main architecture.
- *Inkwell* mainly handles user requests and server responses.
- It is not a data-processing pipeline.
- Event-driven ideas may still be used for individual features. For example, publishing a post could trigger a notification to followers. This would not change the overall architecture.

##### Consequences

**Positive**

- Supports fast and gradual development.
- Keeps the code organized and easier to maintain.
- Makes it easier to separate features, such as search or notifications, into their own services if the project grows.

**Negative**

- The Express server is a single deployment.
- If the server crashes, all API features become unavailable.
- This is an acceptable trade-off for this project.
- We can revisit this decision if the system later requires higher availability.
